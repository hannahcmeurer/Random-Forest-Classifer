# Random-Forest-Classifer
 This project is to replicate a figure from The Element of Stastical Learning: Data Mining, Inferebce, and prediction by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman. Specifally it is the replication of a random forest Classifier (Figure 15.11)in comparison to a 3 nearest neighbors on a mixture data.
 
 From the Hastie book, in the notes it is mentioned that that they use the randomForest package n R maintain by Andy Liaw, found on the CRAN website. As well as the random forest by Andele Cutler and Leo Brieman. 
 
 Completing this is for a CS599 course at NAU.
